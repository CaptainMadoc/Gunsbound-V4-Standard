Theses variables are going into be merged into gunSettings : {}
"fireTypes"
"casingFX"
"bypassShellEject"
"muzzlePosition"
"casing"

Also those are going to be renamed

bypassShellEject >> chamberEjection
casing >> casingPosition
casingFX >> showCasings

these are going to be backwards compatible for not a long time.
Make sure you have changes those before our release. -- Rexmeck
